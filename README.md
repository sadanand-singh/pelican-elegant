Please visit [Elegant - a theme for Pelican](http://oncrashreboot.com/pelican-elegant) for a detailed list of features and documentation.

Elegant offers several unique features including search, live filter, collapsible comments, Mailchimp, custom 404 page, etc. It is a minimal, and stylish theme that looks amazing across all screen resolutions and devices.  

I have modified this theme heavily taking additional stuff from other themes like pelican-bootstrap3.

Additional Parameters that can be used are:
- USE_OPEN_GRAPH = True
- TWITTER_CARDS = True
- OPEN_GRAPH_FB_APP_ID = "ID from FB"
- OPEN_GRAPH_IMAGE = "static Path to Image"

Also, In any markdown file for an article you can use the "og_image" meta tag to change Open Graph image for a particular
article.
